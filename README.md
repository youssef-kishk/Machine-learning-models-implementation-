# Machine-learning-models-implementation-
 A complete python implementation for different machine learning models applied on small sets of data for practicing and deep understanding of each model &amp; its implementation techniques

## **Linear regression**  
Linear regression complete implemetation in python using **gradient descent** or **normal equation** for calculating the variant theta's values of the decreasing cost function with a goal of finding the best fit line for the given data points either for single variable or multi variables data.


## **Single classification** 
Single variable classification (0 or 1) in python using **sigmoid function**



## **Neural nets** 
A complete python implementation for neural networks using sigmoid function and by applying forward propagation and backward propagation to decrease the cost function to its minimal values so the neural net efficiency becomes as good as possible.



## **SVM**
svm for spam mails classification



## **K-Means clustering**
Full implementation in python for unsupervised learning K-means clustring algorithm.


## **PCA**
